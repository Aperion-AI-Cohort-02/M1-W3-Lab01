#  The Cozy Bean -- Script 00: Check Your Setup
#  Run this FIRST, before anything else in this lab.

#  Week 2 checked five libraries. This week there are SIX --
#  google-play-scraper is the one new install.
#  Nothing here can break anything; run it as often as you like.
#
#  Run:   python scripts/00_check_setup.py  (from M1-W3-Lab01/)
